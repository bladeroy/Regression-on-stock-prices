# Regression-on-stock-prices
The project is to build 3 different types of Regression lines to predict 'Apple'stock prices using Python, then print out the prediction for the best performing one.

# Used <b>Scikit learn</b> to try out 3 different types of regression models(Linear, Ridge and Lasso) to predict the price of that stock for a future date and visualize the result using matplotlib.
